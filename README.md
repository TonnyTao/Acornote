A note app by [Tonny&Sunm](https://tonnysunm.github.io). It will be continually updated.

We are lifelong learners, struggled for many years in Notes, Evernote, Quizlet, Memrise...Those apps did not provide advanced features for us, as designer and developer, we canot bear them any longer, so we create own note app - acorn note.

This repository constains design and source code:

* Sketch design, by [Sunm](https://dribbble.com/sunmlu)
* iOS (99% finished)
* [Android](Acornote_Android/README.md)
* Kotlin
* React Native

## Basic
* Learn, memorize, active or deep-learn any new things with `context`
* Context contains useful resource, such as words, sentence, audio, url, image...
* Put context in the first place
* Keep app extrame simple
* Use the state of art, such as text pronunciation, image searching, quizlet...

##App logic
* Use Folders to represent context
* A Folder may refer to a url, may be audio playable, flipable, or markable
* A Folder contains many items
* A item may be is a new word, an interesting sentence, a sudden inspiration...

##Folders

* Vocabulary in specific field, such as food

* Oral English expression
