A note app by [Tonny&Sunm](https://tonnysunm.github.io).

We are happy to be lifelong learners, but sometime struggled in Notes, Evernote, Quizlet, Memrise and other notes app, you named it. The complicated features are not what we want. As designer and developer, why not create our own notes app, just for fun.

This repository constains design and source code:

* Sketch design, by [Sunm](https://dribbble.com/sunmlu)
* iOS app in Swift (99% finished)
* Android app in Kotlin (ongoing)

## Draft ideas
* Put context in the first place
* Learn, memorize, active or deep-learn any new things in `context`
* Context contains useful resource, such as words, sentence, audio, url, image...
* Keep this app simple
* Use the state of art, such as text pronunciation, image searching, quizlet...

## App structure
* Use Folders to represent context
* A Folder may contains a url, may be audio playable, flipable, or markable
* A Folder contains multiple items
* A item is an idea, it may be a vocabulary, an interesting sentence, a sudden inspiration...

## Folders

A Folder is a context, we create folders in below cases

* A book
* A movie
* Vocabulary in specific field, such as food
* A post from Medium
* Oral English expression
* A audio with transcript: BBC, VOA,...
* Url bookmarks for sketch, Swift,...
* What we will eat today?
* Shopping list
* TODO list about our apps, our websites...
* Cook recipe
* ...
